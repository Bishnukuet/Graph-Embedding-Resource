# Protein Function Annotation Tools

Thanks to recent developments in genomic sequencing technologies, the number of protein sequences in public databases is growing enormously.
In order to exploit more fully this huge quantity of data, protein sequences need to be annotated with functional properties such as Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and Gene Ontology terms. 
The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) is currently the largest and most comprehensive resource for protein sequence and annotation data. According to the March 2018 release of UniProtKB, some 556,000 sequences are manually curated but over 111 million sequences lack functional annotations. 
The ability to automatically annotate protein sequences in UniProtKB/TrEMBL, the non-reviewed UniProt sequence repository, would represent a major step towards bridging the gap between annotated and unannotated protein sequences.

Here, I ensemble a curated list of resources regarding the research in protein function annotation. 

#The repository for protein data:
- **Uniprot Knowledge Base**
  -[[SwissProt]](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=reviewed:yes)
  -[[TrEMBL]](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=reviewed:no)
- ** Protein Data Bank PDB **
  -[[PDB]] (https://www.rcsb.org/)
  -[[wwwPDB]] (http://www.wwpdb.org/)
- **Protein Domain Data Base**
  -[[InterPro]] (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/)
  -[[pfam]] (https://pfam.xfam.org/)
